# STAT371 Final Project - How Many Blue Bloods Does It Take to Screw in a Light Bulb?

## How many programmers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
- None. Thatâ€™s a hardware problem.

Used Pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib to read data from a .csv file of NBA team data to determine on average how many players from the college basketball "blue bloods" it took to win the championship that year. 

**Data Attribution:** The data used in this project is sourced from [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), a valuable resource for basketball statistics.
